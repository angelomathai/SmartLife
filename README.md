# SmartLife
Android based project for home automation using arduino, bluetooth and voice commands.
Components required: Arduino UNO, Bluetooth module HC-05, 4 channel relay, Jumper Wires, Android phone.
The arduino gets the input from the Android App in the form of Ascii value and turns each channel of the relay high/low 
depending on the input.
Also voice commands like 'Turn on switch one' can be given to turn ON the appliances.


Arduino IDE code for the project is also attached along with the Android Studio code.
